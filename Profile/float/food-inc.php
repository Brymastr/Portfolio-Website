					<td>Food Inc. was the first name I could think of for our site and
						the name seemed to stick throughout development. This was a school
						project for Intro to Web Development. There were five people on
						our team including myself and we worked on it over the course of
						seven weeks. On the final day of the course each team voted for
						their favorite and our site received the most votes giving our
						site the title of best in the program. This assignment was to
						create a site with dummy content just to showcase layout and
						functionality</td>

					<td>Part of the assignment was to include a JQuery element in the
						site. We wanted something that could showcase the magnificent
						photography contained in our site. This is a simple JQuery image
						carousel. All of the photographs on our site were taken by one of
						the team members.</td>

					<td>We decided to include another JQuery element to improve the
						overall look and feel of the site. For our recipes page we found a
						JQuery plugin that fit perfectly with our content. As you mouse
						over a recipe item, a description box pops in from whichever side
						your mouse entered the div.</td>

					<td>We were required to build a custom, functioning form page and
						implement JavaScript form validation. Required form fields with
						invalid data are tinted red to indicate an input error. The site
						is backed my a database to handle users, content, and comments.
						User login and account management is fully functional and with
						working server side login form validation.</td>

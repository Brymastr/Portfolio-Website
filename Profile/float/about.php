				Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to get to know me! I will make
				sure to keep this up-to-date for your reading pleasure. First off I
				love programming. I could sit down and code for a week straight if I
				had the opportunity, but unfortunately school and work often like to
				get in between my computer and I. My main focus is website
				development and design, however I still like to play around with
				other technologies like mobile app development. In my free time, and
				while I'm not building websites, I like to test out android
				applications and custom ROMs and kernals on my phone and tablet.
				Aside and conversely from sitting at my computer I like to stay
				athletic. I have also loved writing for as long as I can remember.
				In middleschool and highschool I won the speech competion every year
				with my inteligent and witty sentences. Writing was something that
				really came naturally to me from a relatively young age and I really
				think that translated to my coding. In highschool I learned
				ActionScript and used <i>Macromedia</i> Flash (old, I know) to make
				flash websites and a couple platformer games. What really got me
				started on website dev was when we started using Dreamveaver in
				grade 10. It was outdated even at the time but it certainly sufficed
				to spark my desire to build a career in programming.

			<p>Other than this portfolio page I build my Wordpress themes using
				the Thematic framework. I like it because it includes tons of widget
				areas and it has built in search engine optimization which cuts out
				hours of work for each new site. Best of all Thematic is FREE! I
				have tried out a few others including CarringtonJAM and have toyed
				with the Genisis framework. At BCIT I'm taking a widely recognized
				two year program called the Computer Systems Technology Diploma and
				I plan on continuing another two years to complete my Bachelor of
				Technology. So far in school I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
				PHP, MySQL, and Java. The next few years will include more of the
				same as well as C, C++, C#, and advanced architectural computing. I
				built this site from scratch as practice to really get to know all
				aspects of HTML and JavaScript. For most of my programming years I
				worked in Windows and had no complaints. The year that I tried Linux
				really changed my view on Operating Systems. Since then I have made
				the jump to apple and really love and prefer doing most of my
				programming in OS X. In the future once I am more financialy stable
				and can afford to do some more experimenting I want to do more
				android development. I really can't wait to try out the new Android
				Studio that Google unveiled at I/O 2013.</p>

			<p>In 2011 I bought my very own 13" MacBook Pro for way too much
				money and I've loved it like my child ever since. I really liked the
				idea of the triple-booted computer. The first month I had it it was
				running OS X 10.7, Windows 7, and Ubuntu 11.04. I have greatly
				upgraded the OSs since as well as the hardware. Apple really makes
				it hard to tinker with the internals of their hardware so all I
				could do to upgrade it was hard drive and RAM. So with $200 I threw
				in a 1TB HDD and 16GB of DDR3 1333MHZ RAM. I have never had troubles
				with this beauty. People call me an Apple fanboy saying I don't know
				anything about computer internals but then I stomp their slanderous
				high by spouting every detail about both my computer AND theirs. My
				2.7GHZ i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD, 8-hour battery usually reign
				victorious. Aside from mac-hacking I also love android rooting. I've
				really enjoyed rooting and fully unlocking my HTC Sensation 4G. It
				was top of the line upon release in 2011, and still holds up against
				todays top phones. As soon as I the Samsung Nexus 10 was in stock
				(after months of waiting) I bought one and rooted it the same day it
				arrived in the mail. I use it mostly for Reddit now sadly, but
				occasionally I get to test some small thing I built with the android
				SDK.</p>

			<p>I first started playing Soccer, Basketball, Baseball and Box
				Lacrosse in kindergarten at age 6. Track and field started at age 10
				and Volleyball started in middle school at age 15. Some time between
				grade 5 and graduation I fit in a bit of football, golf, and field
				lacrosse. All together I must have played over 50 seasons of
				organized sports. During high school I really focused on Volleyball
				and Track and Field as well as skiing. In track I competed in 100m,
				200m, Long Jump and Triple Jump; all four of which I competed at a
				provincial level. My 100m PB was something under 11.75 seconds and
				my Long Jump PB topped 6.35 meters! That's nothing compared to
				Olympic athletes but I felt pretty accomplished as a first year
				university student. Since then I blew out my knee attempting a
				whimpy 360 on my skis and haven't been able to jump anymore.
